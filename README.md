# FreshRSS TwitchChannel2RssFeed

Transfer on the fly a Twitch-Channel into an RSS Feed. I just change [@cn-tools](https://github.com/cn-tools/)'s [YouTubeChannel2RssFeed](https://github.com/cn-tools/cntools_FreshRssExtensions/tree/master/xExtension-YouTubeChannel2RssFeed) extensions for Twitch Channels.\
Required FreshRSS version at least v1.16

You can easily add Twitch channel by pasting URLs like:

- `https://www.twitch.tv/babicop`
- `https://twitch.tv/babicop`

## Installation

To install an extension, download the extension archive first and extract it on your PC.\
Then, upload the specific extension(s) you want on your server.

Extensions must be in the ./extensions directory of your FreshRSS installation.
